# Preface {-}

The purpose of this book is to provide a step by step guide of LDA utilizing Gibbs Sampling.  It is
heavily inspired by the Gregor Heinrich's _Parameter Estimation for Text Analysis_[@heinrich2008parameter]. 

# Background {-}
I've often found that resources covering LDA are either hard to follow, do to a heavy reliance on calculus derivations, or the resources are extremely high level so you get the idea of what LDA accomplishes, but you never fully grasp how it works. The book focuses on LDA for inference via Gibbs Sampling. To aid in understanding both LDA and Gibbs sampling all probability distributions used in LDA will be reviewed along with a variety of different approaches for parameter estimation. Following the introduction of these components, LDA will be presented as a generative model.  This will lay the groundwork for understanding how LDA can be used for inference of topics in a corpus.   

# Layout of Book {-}

* What is LDA? - High level overview
* Parameter Estimation Methods (general overview using Bernoulli distribution) - ML, MAP, Bayesian Inference, Gibbs Sampling
* Multinomial Distribution - Explains the relationship of Bernoulli to Multinomial, then goes into Gibbs Sampling 
* Word/Document Structures - Bag of Words, Word Document Matrix
* LDA - A Generative Model
* LDA - Inference
