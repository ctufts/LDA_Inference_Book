# Multinomial Distribution

Comparison of a Die vs. Words
The binomial distribution is a special case of the multinomeial distribution 
where the number of possible outcomes is 2. A multinomial distribution can 
have 2 or more outcomes and therefore is normally shown through examples using 
a 6-sided die. To get things on track for LDA, let's instead think of 1 
document (similar to the die), with 6 distinct words (the 6 sides of the die):

"Latent Dirichlet Allocation has many peices"

From the example above we would assume each word has an equal probability (think 
fair die) because each word is unique. Therefore each word has 1/6 chances of being randomly sampled from the document (think 1/6 chance of getting a '1' during a dice roll). 



k sided die n times (in our case n = 1, k = 6)
n = 1, k=2 is bernoulli distribution 
n >1 , k = 2 is binomial distribution

$$
f(x)=\dfrac{n!}{x_1!x_2!\cdots x_k!}\theta_1^{x_1} \theta_2^{x_2} \cdots \theta_k^{x_k}
$$

## Relationship to Bernoulli 

Let's recall the bernoulli probability mass function
$$
P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},...,X_{N}=x_{N}) = \prod\limits_{n=1}^{N} \theta^{x}(1-\theta)^{1-x}
$$
Let's swap in some different terms. We can replace the first term, $\theta$, with $\theta_{1}$ and the second term, $(1-\theta)$ as $\theta_{2}$. Then we have:

$$
\prod\limits_{n=1}^{N} {\theta_{1}}^{x_{1}}{\theta_{2}}^{x_{2}}
$$
x's are 1 or zero, so the factorial is always 1 for this example (counts never higher that that). Factorial of _n_ is the same as the product from _n_=1 to _N_. 


```{r multinomialDist, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Sampling from Multinomial with Equal Parameters'}
# draw 1000 samples from multinomial distribution
outcomes <- replicate(10000, which(rmultinom(1,1,rep(1/6,6))==1))
words <- unlist(strsplit("Latent Dirichlet Allocation has many peices", ' '))
ds <- data.frame(id = outcomes, word = sapply(outcomes, function(x)words[x]))
ggplot(ds, aes(x= word)) + geom_histogram(stat='count')

```


## Conjugate Prior: Dirichlet
The conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution is the Dirichlet distribution. Similar
to the beta distribution, it can be though of as a distribution of distributions. Let's first 
take a look at the distribution of both the multinomial and Dirichlet distribution and see if we can find a similar pattern. Remember, conjugate priors have the same form as the estimated posterior of the original distribution.
